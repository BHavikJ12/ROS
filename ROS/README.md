ğŸ‘‹ A Python program that, using ALL the methods from the robot_control_class.py Python script, helps the Turtlebot robot to get out of the maze

âœ¨get_laser (direction): As the name itself says, this method will allow you to get data from the laser of the robot. You will need to pass one parameter to this method:
           >>direction: Here you will specify a number between 0 and 719, which will indicate the direction of the laser reading.
           
âœ¨get_laser_full(): As the name itself says, this method will allow you to get all the data from ALL the laser beams of the robot. As I've said before, this is a total of 719 different readings. So, when called, this method will return a LIST containing all the 719 different readings from the laser beams.

âœ¨move_straight(): As the name says, this method will allow you to start moving the robot in a straight line.

âœ¨stop_robot(): As the name says, this method will allow you to stop the robot from moving.

âœ¨move_straight_time(motion, speed, time): As the name itself says, this method will allow you to move the robot in a straight line. You will need to pass three parameters to it.
           >>motion: Specify here if you want your robot to move forward ("forward") or backward ("backward").
           >>speed: Specify here the speed at which you want your robot to move (in m/s).
           >>time: Specify here how long you want your robot to keep moving (in seconds).

âœ¨turn (clockwise, speed, time): As the name itself says, this method will allow you to turn the robot. You will need to pass three parameters to it.
           >>clockwise: Specify here whether you want your robot to turn clockwise ("clockwise") or counter-clockwise ("counter-clockwise").
           >>speed: Specify here the speed at which you want your robot to turn (in rad/s).
           >>time: Specify here how long you want your robot to keep turning (in seconds).

âœ¨rotate (degrees): This method will allow your robot to rotate for the specified number of degrees.
           >>degrees: The number of degreees you want your robot to rotate.!
